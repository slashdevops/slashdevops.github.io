[{"content":"Introduction I have been using WordPress for a long time to host slashdevops.com blog site. I had been looking for a way to migrate this blog from WordPress to a static site generator and during the research I found Hugo and I can say I am very happy with it. Hugo allows me to write this blog posts in Markdown and it is very fast and easy to use.\nI have also been using GitHub Pages for other of my personal jobs and I decided to migrate this blog GitHub Pages as well.\nTo perform this migration I used the following software:\nHugo GitHub Pages Google Domains Disqus Fuse.js Hugo Theme -\u0026gt; PaperMod, Thanks to Aditya Telange for this theme 🙏. My Experience It took me some time to migrate this blog from WordPress to Hugo and GitHub Pages. I had to learn how to use Hugo, GitHub Pages and how to configure my slashdevops.com domain in Google Domains but it was worth it. I lost some of the WordPress features like comments and likes. Now, the blog implement Disqus for comments, and I am trying to find a way to implement likes.\nThe most hard part was understand how should work the GitHub Pages and Hugo together. There are several tutorials on the internet that can help you with this migration, but not even the official documentation of Hugo and GitHub Pages helped me to understand the fact that you need at least two repositories to have this done. One repository to host the source code of the blog and another repository to host the compiled code of the blog (static files from public folder of Hugo).\nThe source code repository is the one you use to write your blog posts and the compiled code repository is the one you use to host the blog.\nThe Good 👍 Hugo is very fast and easy to use. Hugo allows me to write this blog posts in Markdown. Hugo has a lot of themes to choose from. GitHub Pages is free and easy to use. The blog implement fuzzy search using Fuse.js. The Bad 👎 Migrating from WordPress to Hugo was not easy. I made it manually and it took me some time, fortunately I didn\u0026rsquo;t have many posts. At the beginning, I had some issues with the Hugo theme I chose, but I was able to fix them. I had to learn how to use Hugo and GitHub Pages but it was worth it. I lost some of the WordPress features like comments and likes but I am happy with the result. This blog implement Disqus for comments, and I am trying to find a way to implement likes. I lost the comments and likes from the WordPress posts, I\u0026rsquo;m very sorry about that. Not so Bad not so Good 🫤 To have GitHub Pages for free, I had to use a public repository -\u0026gt; slashdevops.github.io repository, but I am happy with it. This means you are seeing the source code of this blog and how it is built. Currently, I am using Disqus for comments, but I am trying to find a way to implement likes. Relevant steps The most relevant information about this migration is and I like to share with you is:\n1. Repository Configuration As I explained before, to have this blog working properly you need at least two repositories. So, for my migration I used the following repositories:\n1.1 slashdevops.github.io repository This repository slashdevops/slashdevops.github.io is used to host the compiled code of the blog (static files coming from Hugo folder public). This should be filled using the gihub actions workflow to build the blog and push the static files to this repository. This should be public to enable the github pages feature for free.\nThis repository could not be empty to enable the github pages feature. So, I created a index.html file with a minimal content to avoid the repository being empty.\nThe file I added to the repository slashdevops/slashdevops.github.io is:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;Home\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Welcome to the home page!\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; This repository configuration looks like this:\nand after push the minimal html file to the repository, and configure your domain DNS as it is explained in the step 2 below, you can see the blog site working properly.\n1.2 hugo-slashdevops.github.io repository This repository slashdevops/hugo-slashdevops.github.io is used to host the source code of the blog. Basically, this repository contains the Hugo configuration, the Markdown files of the blog posts and the Github Action Workflow to build and deploy the static files. Also, this repository should be private to avoid the source code of the blog being exposed.\nFor the this repository, the hugo configuration is very important to have the blog working properly.\n2. Google Domains Configuration For this configuration, I made the validation of the domain slashdevops.com my github settings and then I configured the domain in Google Domains to point to the GitHub Pages servers.\nThis image shows how I configure the domain in GitHub:\nand this other how looks the domain after the configuration:\nThen, I configured the domain in Google Domains to point to the GitHub Pages servers. This configuration is done in the DNS section of the domain configuration in Google Domains.\nThis image shows how I configured the domain in Google Domains:\nReferences:\nhttps://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-an-apex-domain 3. Hugo Configuration The file Hugo.toml I used to build this blog.\n4. GitHub Workflow The GitHub Workflow -\u0026gt; .github/workflows/hugo.yml\n5. Disqus Configuration The Disqus Configuration I used to implement comments in this blog.\n6. .gitignore configuration The .gitignore configuration I used to ignore some files in this blog.\n7. CNAME configuration The CNAME configuration I used to configure the domain of this blog. Ensure this file contains the domain you want to use.\nReferences:\nhttps://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/troubleshooting-custom-domains-and-github-pages#cname-errors ","permalink":"https://slashdevops.com/post/2024/03/30/1/migrated-from-wordpress-to-hugo-and-github-pages/","summary":"Introduction I have been using WordPress for a long time to host slashdevops.com blog site.

How to use? Jenkins Plugin – Pipeline: Basic Steps –\u0026gt;How to use? Jenkins Plugin – Mask Passwords –\u0026gt; How to use? So, What is the Magic? Why do I say this is secure? Maybe after looking at the following pipeline code, you will see how easy is to use this, and this is secure because if you execute the following code in your pipeline:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 ... stage(\u0026#39;test aws credential\u0026#39;) { steps { withAwsEnVars(roleName:\u0026#39;cicd-execution-role\u0026#39;, roleAccount: \u0026#39;12345678910\u0026#39;) { sh \u0026#34;echo TOKEN: ${AWS_SESSION_TOKEN}\u0026#34; sh \u0026#34;echo KEY: ${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}\u0026#34; sh \u0026#34;echo ID: ${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}\u0026#34; sh \u0026#39;aws s3 ls\u0026#39; } sh \u0026#34;exit 1\u0026#34; } } ... you will see masked the TOKEN, KEY and ID. Instead of seeing the real value, you will see *********** characters.\nTools and Concepts There are various tools and concepts I used here, the first that allows me to do that so easily was Groovy Closures and it is explained how to use on Jenkins Shared Library –\u0026gt; Defining custom steps.\nThen we have the tool withEnv provided by the Jenkins Plugin – Pipeline: Basic Steps and in combination with the use of the Groovy Closures allowed me to export the AWS Environment Variables coming from awsCredentials.getFromAssumeRole(…) groovy function into a container script part.\nBut, make sure that anyone who will use Jenkins Controller and Pipeline doesn’t have access to the values of the AWS Environment Variables is the job of wrap provided by the Jenkins Plugin – Pipeline: Basic Steps + maskPasswords provided by Jenkins Plugin – Mask Passwords.\nOthers Links https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/ https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/using/ https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/security/#securing-jenkins https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/ Closing Even hating Jenkins like me, you can find different ways to do your life easy and secure with him.\nIf you want to look at my GitHub repositories related to Jenkins, here you have:\nhttps://github.com/christiangda/jenkins-casc-controller https://github.com/christiangda/jenkins-shared-library ","permalink":"https://slashdevops.com/post/2022/12/03/1/secure-and-easy-aws-connection-assuming-a-role-with-jenkins-shared-library/","summary":"The Problem Surely and like me, you are trying to be more secure when connecting Jenkins with your AWS Accounts assuming a role.

Basically, this means that your log management/aggregator applications are storing the logs in Elasticsearch using the timestamp (of capture, processing, or another one) for every record of data and grouping, using a pattern for every group.\nIn Elasticsearch terms, this group of logs is called index and the pattern is referring commonly to the suffix used when you create the index name, e.g.: sample-logs-2020-04-25.\nThe problem Until here everything is ok, right? so the problems begin when your data starts accumulating and you don\u0026rsquo;t want to spend too much time/money to store/maintain/delete it.\nAdditionally, you may be managing all the indices the same, regardless of data retention requirements or access patterns. All the indices have the same number of replicas, shards, disk type, etc. In my case, it is more important the first week of indices than the indices three months old.\nAs I mentioned before, depending on your index name and configuration, you will end up with different indexes aggregating logs based on different timeframes.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 ... sample-logs-2020-04-22 sample-logs-2020-04-23 sample-logs-2020-04-24 ... sample-logs-2020-04-27 It is likely that just like I was doing few months back, you are using your custom Script/Application implementing the Elasticsearch Curator API or going directly over the Elasticsearch index API to delete or maintain your indices lifecycle or worst, you are storing your indices forever without any kind of control or deleting it manually.\nMy logs cases Case 1 Third-party applications that use their own index name pattern like indexname-yyyy-mm-dd and I cannot / I don\u0026rsquo;t want to change it. e.g. Zipkin (zipkin-2020-04-25)\nCase 2 My own log aggregator (custom AWS Lambda function) and/or third-party applications like fluentd, LogStash, etc. That allows me to change the index name pattern. So, in this case I can decide how to aggregate my logs and the index pattern name I want to use.\nOne more thing before moving on: The term used for Elasticsearch to create a index per day, hour, month, etc. is rollover.\nThe Solution Preliminaries In my case, I’m using AWS Elasticsearch Service which is a “little bit different” from the Elasticsearch Elastic since AWS decided to create their own Elasticsearch fork called Open Distro for Elasticsearch.\nthe key terms to understand “Index Lifecycle” in every Elasticsearch distribution is:\nIndex State Management (ISM) → Open Distro for Elasticsearch Index lifecycle management (ILM) → Elasticsearch Elastic ElasticSearch concepts are out of the scope of this post, in the below cases I will explain how Open Distro for Elasticsearch manages its indices lifecycle.\nCase 1 \u0026hellip; Remember above.\nThe log management/aggregation application makes the “rollover” of my indices, but I would like to delete/change those after the index has rolled — The most common\nCreate an Index State Management Policy to delete indices based on time and/or size and using an Elasticsearch Templates and Elasticsearch Aliases your Elasticsearch engine can delete your indices periodically.\nAnd yes, the result is very similar to what I was doing with my custom AWS Lambda function in Python using Elasticsearch Curator API\nBut, without the hassle of writing any code, handling connection errors, upgrade my code every time my Elasticsearch was upgraded, credentials, changing the env vars to pass the new indices name, etc.\nNow, thanks to ISM I can use a JSON declarative language to define some rules (policies) and the Elasticsearch engine is in charge of the rest.\nPolicies? … imagine you can implement this kind of rules\nKeep “my fresh indices” open to write for 2 days, then After the 2 first days, closes those indices for write operations and keep them until 13 days more, then 15 days after index creation, delete it forever, end What does this means? well, after learning about the ISM Policies and using Kibana Dev Tool, I created a policy name delete_after_15d following the rules described above, and here you have it.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 # ISM Policy delete_after_15d PUT _opendistro/_ism/policies/delete_after_15d { \u0026#34;policy\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;policy_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;delete_after_15d\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Maintains the indices open by 2 days, then closes those and delete indices after 15 days\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;default_state\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ReadWrite\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;schema_version\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;states\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ReadWrite\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;actions\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;read_write\u0026#34;: {} } ], \u0026#34;transitions\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;state_name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ReadOnly\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;conditions\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;min_index_age\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2d\u0026#34; } } ] }, { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ReadOnly\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;actions\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;read_only\u0026#34;: {} } ], \u0026#34;transitions\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;state_name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Delete\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;conditions\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;min_index_age\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;13d\u0026#34; } } ] }, { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Delete\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;actions\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;delete\u0026#34;: {} } ] } ] } } NOTE: Notice the highlighted lines, are these my rules described above?\nThen using the following Elasticsearch Templates, I applied the policy (above), see template line (below) 8, to my indices following a pattern in the line 5\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 # Template sample-logs to apply the ISM Policy delete_after_15d to new indices PUT _template/sample-logs { \u0026#34;index_patterns\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;sample-logs-*\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;settings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;index.opendistro.index_state_management.policy_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;delete_after_15d\u0026#34; } } Now what?

Now you have only one index name (index alias) to configure your Custom Program / LogStash / Fluentd, etc and you can forget the suffix pattern.\nHere is an example of how to insert data using the rollover index alias:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 # Bulk load sample, NOTE: To insert data use the rollover aliases POST _bulk {\u0026#34;index\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;_index\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;sample-logs-rollover\u0026#34;}} {\u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;This is a log sample 1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;@timestamp\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2020-04-26T11:07:00+0000\u0026#34;} {\u0026#34;index\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;_index\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;sample-logs-rollover\u0026#34;}} {\u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;This is a log sample 2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;@timestamp\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2020-04-26T11:08:00+0000\u0026#34;} Conclusions If you have Elasticsearch as your logs storage and index platform and you never used before or heard about it:\nIndex State Management (ISM) → Open Distro for Elasticsearch Index lifecycle management (ILM) → Elasticsearch Elastic Then, Go fast and learn how to apply this to improve your everyday job.\nAcknowledgements This was possible thanks to my friend Alejandro Sabater, who took his free time to review it and share its recommendation with me.\n","permalink":"https://slashdevops.com/post/2020/05/13/1/managing-the-lifecycle-of-your-elasticsearch-indices/","summary":"Managing the Lifecycle of your Elasticsearch Indices Just like me, you are probably storing your [Applications | Infrastructure | IoT ] Logs / Traces (as a time series) into Elasticsearch or at least considering doing it.\nIf that is the case, you might be wondering how to efficiently manage index lifecycles in an automated and clean manner, then this post is for you!\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s happening?
