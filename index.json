[{"content":"Introduction I have been using WordPress for a long time to host slashdevops.com blog site. I had been looking for a way to migrate this blog from WordPress to a static site generator and during the research I found Hugo and I can say I am very happy with it. Hugo allows me to write this blog posts in Markdown and it is very fast and easy to use.\nI have also been using GitHub Pages for other of my personal jobs and I decided to migrate this blog GitHub Pages as well.\nTo perform this migration I used the following software:\nHugo GitHub Pages GitHub Actions GitHub CLI Google Domains Disqus Fuse.js Hugo Theme -\u0026gt; PaperMod, Thanks to Aditya Telange for this theme üôè. My Experience It took me some time to migrate this blog from WordPress to Hugo and GitHub Pages. I had to learn how to use Hugo, GitHub Pages and how to configure my slashdevops.com domain in Google Domains but it was worth it.\nNow, the blog implement Disqus for comments and likes and it is very fast and responsive. Also, the blog implement fuzzy search using Fuse.js. I decided to lost the comments and likes from the WordPress posts, I\u0026rsquo;m very sorry about that.\nüëâ The most hard part was understand how should work the GitHub Pages and Hugo together.\nThere are several tutorials on the internet that can help you with this migration, but not even the official documentation of Hugo and GitHub Pages helped me to understand the fact that one of the best way is implementing two repositories to have this done - one repository to host the source code of the blog (the hugo repository, where you create the Markdown files) and another repository to host the compiled code of the blog (static files generated from hugo and in the public folder of the first repo).\nJust to clarify, the source code repository is the one you use to write your blog posts and the compiled code repository is the one you use to host the blog.\nYes, truth, there are several ways to have this done, there are many blog posts and tutorials on the internet that can help you with this configuration of Github Pages and Hugo, the majority of these use two repositories approach with git submodules or override the docs folder of the same repository. Also, you can use a different branch in the same repository to store the static files generated from hugo, the last one is use the same repository to store the source code and the static files and deploy the static files to the Github Pages using a Workflow.\nI decided to use the two repositories approach without git submodules implementation because it is easier to maintain, understand and has me the ability to keep the hugo repository (source code) private.\nThe Good üëç Hugo is very fast and \u0026ldquo;easy to use\u0026rdquo; (ones you understand its philosophy). Hugo allows me to write this blog posts in Markdown. Hugo has a lot of themes to choose from. GitHub Pages could be free and \u0026ldquo;easy to use\u0026rdquo;. The blog is very fast and responsive. The blog implement fuzzy search using Fuse.js thanks to the Hugo Theme PaperMod implementation/integration. The blog is very easy to maintain and update. The Bad üëé Migrating from WordPress to Hugo was not easy. I made it manually and it took me some time, fortunately I didn\u0026rsquo;t have many posts. At the beginning, I had some issues with the Hugo theme I chose (PaperMod), but I was able to fix them after understanding how Hugo works. I lost the comments and likes from the WordPress posts, I\u0026rsquo;m very sorry about that. I take some time to have the right configuration of the GitHub Pages to use a public repository to host the blog (static files) and a private repository to host the source code of the blog (hugo files) and the magic to do that was the Github Actions Workflow I made. Not so Bad / Not so Good ü´§ I had to learn how to use Hugo and GitHub Pages, it takes some time, but it was worth it. To have GitHub Pages for free, I had to use a public repository -\u0026gt; slashdevops.github.io, but I am happy with it. This means you are seeing the code of this blog and how it is built (static files). Fortunately, I can have a private repository to host the source code of the blog (hugo implementation). Relevant steps This is not a detailed guide step by step, because I made this migration in a series of back and forth steps until this worked, but I want to share with you the most relevant steps I took to have this blog working properly.\nThe steps I\u0026rsquo;m sharing here are not necessary in the order I did them, and some of them are interdependent, but I will try to explain them in the order I think is more relevant.\nNOTES:\nYou should have installed and configured GitHub CLI to perform some of these steps. You should have installed and configured Hugo to perform some of these steps. 1. Repository Configuration As I explained before, to have this blog working properly I needed two two repositories.\nslashdevops.github.io: The repository to host the compiled code of the blog (static files coming from Hugo folder public). hugo-slashdevops.github.io: The repository to host the source code of the blog. üëâ I create these using the GitHub CLI, but you can create them using the GitHub web interface as well.\n1 2 3 4 5 # Create the repository to host the compiled code of the blog gh repo create slashdevops/slashdevops.github.io --public --description \u0026#34;slashdevops.com blog site\u0026#34; --clone --gitignore \u0026#34;html\u0026#34; # Create the repository to host the source code of the blog gh repo create slashdevops/hugo-slashdevops.github.io --private --description \u0026#34;slashdevops.com blog site source code\u0026#34; --clone So, for my migration I used the following repositories:\n1.1 slashdevops.github.io repository Repository slashdevops/slashdevops.github.io is public and it is used to host the compiled code of the blog (static files coming from Hugo folder public).\nThis should be filled by a GitHub Actions -\u0026gt; Workflow that will be in the repository hugo-slashdevops.github.io and used to build the blog and push the static files generated in the public folder to this repository.\nThis repository should not be empty to enable the GitHub Pages feature. So, I created a index.html file with a minimal content to avoid the repository being empty and to test the Github Pages configuration.\nüëâ The file I added to the repository slashdevops/slashdevops.github.io in the beginning was:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;slashdevops.com blog page\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Welcome to the home page\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; üëâ And the configuration of this repository in the GitHub is:\nüëâ And after push the minimal html file to the repository, and configure your domain DNS as it is explained in the step 2 below, you can see the blog site working properly.\n1.2 hugo-slashdevops.github.io repository Repository slashdevops/hugo-slashdevops.github.io is private and it is used to host the source code of the blog. Basically, this repository contains the Hugo configuration, the Markdown files of the blog posts and the Github Action -\u0026gt; Workflow to build and deploy the static files into the repository slashdevops.github.io.\nI used the .github/workflows/hugo.yaml configuration file recommended in Hugo - Host on GitHub Pages \u0026ndash; and then I modified it to fit my needs, which is to have two repositories, one for the source code and another for the static files. \u0026ndash;. This modification allows me to build the blog and deploy the static files to the repository slashdevops.github.io using git commands.\nIMPORTANT: I needed to configure the Github Actions -\u0026gt; Workflow to use the GITHUB_TOKEN with the right permissions to allow the deployment of the static files to the repository slashdevops.github.io. I named it ACTIONS_GITHUB_TOKEN (see the line 81 of the code below).\nüëâ The content of the secret ACTIONS_GITHUB_TOKEN was created in the repository slashdevops/hugo-slashdevops.github.io in the Settings -\u0026gt; Secrets section of the repository and I used the GitHub CLI to create it.\n1 2 3 4 5 # Create the token gh auth token # Set the token in the repository slashdevops/hugo-slashdevops.github.io gh secret set ACTIONS_GITHUB_TOKEN -r slashdevops/hugo-slashdevops.github.io -b \u0026lt;token generated before\u0026gt; üëâ The code of the Github Action -\u0026gt; Workflow I used to build and deploy the blog is:\nSource: slashdevops/hugo-slashdevops.github.io -\u0026gt; .github/workflows/hugo.yml private repository.\nNOTES:\nThis is a private repository, so you can\u0026rsquo;t see the code, but I will show you the code here. Highlighted lines are the most important lines in the code. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 # Sample workflow for building and deploying a Hugo site to GitHub Pages name: Deploy Hugo site to Pages on: # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch push: branches: [\u0026#34;main\u0026#34;] # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab workflow_dispatch: # Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages permissions: contents: read id-token: write # Default to bash defaults: run: shell: bash jobs: # Build job build: runs-on: ubuntu-latest env: SITE_URL: \u0026#34;https://slashdevops.com\u0026#34; HUGO_VERSION: 0.124.1 steps: - name: Install Hugo CLI run: | wget -O ${{ runner.temp }}/hugo.deb https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v${HUGO_VERSION}/hugo_extended_${HUGO_VERSION}_linux-amd64.deb \\ \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo dpkg -i ${{ runner.temp }}/hugo.deb - name: Install Dart Sass run: sudo snap install dart-sass - name: Checkout uses: actions/checkout@v4 with: submodules: recursive fetch-depth: 1 - name: Build with Hugo env: # For maximum backward compatibility with Hugo modules HUGO_ENVIRONMENT: production HUGO_ENV: production run: | hugo \\ --gc \\ --minify \\ --baseURL \u0026#34;${{ env.SITE_URL }}/\u0026#34; - name: Show files run: tree -I \u0026#39;.git\u0026#39; -a - name: Upload artifact uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4 with: name: static-files path: ./public retention-days: 1 overwrite: true # Deployment job deploy: env: STATIC_SITE_REPO: \u0026#34;slashdevops/slashdevops.github.io\u0026#34; STATIC_SITE_REPO_BRANCH: main runs-on: ubuntu-latest needs: build steps: - name: Checkout uses: actions/checkout@v4 with: repository: ${{ env.STATIC_SITE_REPO }} ref: ${{ env.STATIC_SITE_REPO_BRANCH }} token: ${{ secrets.ACTIONS_GITHUB_TOKEN }} - name: Download artifact uses: actions/download-artifact@v4 with: name: static-files path: . - name: Show files run: tree -I \u0026#39;.git\u0026#39; -a - name: Commit changes run: | git config --local user.name \u0026#34;GitHub Actions from hugo-slashdevops.github.io repo\u0026#34; git config --local user.email \u0026#34;66886265+christian-slashdevops@users.noreply.github.com\u0026#34; git add . git commit -m \u0026#34;Deploy site\u0026#34; git push --force origin ${{ env.STATIC_SITE_REPO_BRANCH }} 2. Google Domains Configuration I made the validation of the domain slashdevops.com on my GitHub Settings account and then I configured the domain in Google Domains to point to the GitHub Pages servers (list of IPs in Configuring an apex domain).\nNOTES:\nThis step is not necessary if you are using the GitHub Pages domain, but it is recommended for security reasons. üëâ This image shows how I configure the verified domains in GitHub Settings:\nüëâ After the Validation of the domain, I added the domain to the GitHub Pages configuration in the repository slashdevops.github.io settings.\nThen, I configured the domain in Google Domains to point to the GitHub Pages servers. This configuration is done in the DNS section of the domain configuration in Google Domains.\nüëâ This image shows how I configured the domain in Google Domains:\nReferences:\nhttps://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-an-apex-domain 3. Hugo Configuration Here there are some relevant configurations I made, let me enumerate them:\nThe hugo.toml configuration file. The hugo static files content. You will need to put at least the CNAME file in the static folder to configure the domain in GitHub Pages. Enabling messages and likes with Disqus. üëâ 1. My hugo configuration is very simple, I used the Hugo Theme -\u0026gt; PaperMod Wiki file as template and I made some changes to fit my needs.\nMy hugo.toml configuration files is:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 baseURL = \u0026#34;https://slashdevops.com/\u0026#34; languageCode = \u0026#34;en-us\u0026#34; title = \u0026#34;SlashDevOps\u0026#34; theme = \u0026#34;PaperMod\u0026#34; # Read: https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/wiki/FAQs#using-hugos-syntax-highlighter-chroma # https://bwaycer.github.io/hugo_tutorial.hugo/extras/highlighting/ pygmentsUseClasses = true ############################################################################### # metadata enableRobotsTXT = true buildDrafts = false buildFuture = false buildExpired = false [minify] disableXML = true minifyOutput = true ############################################################################### # menu [[menu.main]] identifier = \u0026#34;categories\u0026#34; name = \u0026#34;Categories\u0026#34; url = \u0026#34;/categories/\u0026#34; weight = 10 [[menu.main]] identifier = \u0026#34;GitHub\u0026#34; name = \u0026#34;GitHub\u0026#34; url = \u0026#34;https://github.com/slashdevops\u0026#34; weight = 10 [[menu.main]] identifier = \u0026#34;tags\u0026#34; name = \u0026#34;Tags\u0026#34; url = \u0026#34;/tags/\u0026#34; weight = 20 [[menu.main]] identifier = \u0026#34;blog\u0026#34; name = \u0026#34;Blog\u0026#34; url = \u0026#34;/post/\u0026#34; weight = 20 [[menu.main]] identifier = \u0026#34;search\u0026#34; name = \u0026#34;Search\u0026#34; url = \u0026#34;/search\u0026#34; weight = 20 [[menu.main]] identifier = \u0026#34;archives\u0026#34; name = \u0026#34;Archives\u0026#34; url = \u0026#34;/archives\u0026#34; weight = 20 ############################################################################### # params [params] env = \u0026#34;production\u0026#34; title = \u0026#34;SlashDevOps\u0026#34; description = \u0026#34;SlashDevOps is a blog about DevOps, Cloud, Containers, Kubernetes, CI/CD, Automation, Infrastructure as Code, and more.\u0026#34; keywords = [ \u0026#34;DevOps\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Cloud\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Containers\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Kubernetes\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;CI/CD\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Automation\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Infrastructure as Code\u0026#34;, ] author = \u0026#34;Christian Gonz√°lez Di Antonio\u0026#34; defaultTheme = \u0026#34;auto\u0026#34; # auto | light | dark disableThemeToggle = false ShowReadingTime = true ShowShareButtons = true ShowPostNavLinks = true ShowBreadCrumbs = true ShowCodeCopyButtons = true ShowWordCount = true ShowRssButtonInSectionTermList = true UseHugoToc = true disableSpecial1stPost = false disableScrollToTop = false comments = true hidemeta = false hideSummary = false showtoc = true tocopen = true searchHidden = false # logo [params.label] text = \u0026#34;slashdevops.com\u0026#34; icon = \u0026#34;/safari-pinned-tab.svg\u0026#34; iconHeight = 45 # profile mode [params.profileMode] enabled = false # home page [params.homeInfoParams] Title = \u0026#34;SlashDevops\u0026#39;s Blog\u0026#34; Content = \u0026#34;üëâ Welcome to the SlashDevOps blog.

Basically, this means that your log management/aggregator applications are storing the logs in Elasticsearch using the timestamp (of capture, processing, or another one) for every record of data and grouping, using a pattern for every group.\nIn Elasticsearch terms, this group of logs is called index and the pattern is referring commonly to the suffix used when you create the index name, e.g.: sample-logs-2020-04-25.\nThe problem Until here everything is ok, right? so the problems begin when your data starts accumulating and you don\u0026rsquo;t want to spend too much time/money to store/maintain/delete it.\nAdditionally, you may be managing all the indices the same, regardless of data retention requirements or access patterns. All the indices have the same number of replicas, shards, disk type, etc. In my case, it is more important the first week of indices than the indices three months old.\nAs I mentioned before, depending on your index name and configuration, you will end up with different indexes aggregating logs based on different timeframes.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 ... sample-logs-2020-04-22 sample-logs-2020-04-23 sample-logs-2020-04-24 ... sample-logs-2020-04-27 It is likely that just like I was doing few months back, you are using your custom Script/Application implementing the Elasticsearch Curator API or going directly over the Elasticsearch index API to delete or maintain your indices lifecycle or worst, you are storing your indices forever without any kind of control or deleting it manually.\nMy logs cases Case 1 Third-party applications that use their own index name pattern like indexname-yyyy-mm-dd and I cannot / I don\u0026rsquo;t want to change it.¬†e.g. Zipkin¬†(zipkin-2020-04-25)\nCase 2 My own log aggregator (custom AWS Lambda function) and/or third-party applications like fluentd, LogStash, etc. That allows me to change the index name pattern. So, in this case I can decide how to aggregate my logs and the index pattern name I want to use.\nOne more thing before moving on: The term used for Elasticsearch to create a index per day, hour, month, etc. is rollover.\nThe Solution Preliminaries In my case, I‚Äôm using AWS Elasticsearch Service which is a ‚Äúlittle bit different‚Äù from the Elasticsearch Elastic since AWS decided to create their own Elasticsearch fork called Open Distro for Elasticsearch.\nthe key terms to understand ‚ÄúIndex Lifecycle‚Äù in every Elasticsearch distribution is:\nIndex State Management (ISM) ‚Üí Open Distro for Elasticsearch Index lifecycle management (ILM) ‚Üí Elasticsearch Elastic ElasticSearch concepts are out of the scope of this post, in the below cases I will explain how Open Distro for Elasticsearch manages its indices lifecycle.\nCase 1 \u0026hellip; Remember above.\nThe log management/aggregation application makes the ‚Äúrollover‚Äù of my indices, but I would like to delete/change those after the index has rolled ‚Äî The most common\nCreate an Index State Management Policy to delete indices based on time and/or size and using an Elasticsearch Templates and Elasticsearch Aliases your Elasticsearch engine can delete your indices periodically.\nAnd yes, the result is very similar to what I was doing with my custom AWS Lambda function in Python using Elasticsearch Curator API\nBut, without the hassle of writing any code, handling connection errors, upgrade my code every time my Elasticsearch was upgraded, credentials, changing the env vars to pass the new indices name, etc.\nNow, thanks to ISM I can use a JSON declarative language to define some rules (policies) and the Elasticsearch engine is in charge of the rest.\nPolicies? ‚Ä¶ imagine you can implement this kind of rules\nKeep ‚Äúmy fresh indices‚Äù open to write for 2 days, then After the 2 first days, closes those indices for write operations and keep them until 13 days more, then 15 days after index creation, delete it forever, end What does this means? well, after learning about the ISM Policies and using Kibana Dev Tool, I created a policy name delete_after_15d following the rules described above, and here you have it.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 # ISM Policy delete_after_15d PUT _opendistro/_ism/policies/delete_after_15d { \u0026#34;policy\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;policy_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;delete_after_15d\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Maintains the indices open by 2 days, then closes those and delete indices after 15 days\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;default_state\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ReadWrite\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;schema_version\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;states\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ReadWrite\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;actions\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;read_write\u0026#34;: {} } ], \u0026#34;transitions\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;state_name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ReadOnly\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;conditions\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;min_index_age\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2d\u0026#34; } } ] }, { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ReadOnly\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;actions\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;read_only\u0026#34;: {} } ], \u0026#34;transitions\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;state_name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Delete\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;conditions\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;min_index_age\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;13d\u0026#34; } } ] }, { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Delete\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;actions\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;delete\u0026#34;: {} } ] } ] } } NOTE: Notice the highlighted lines, are these my rules described above?\nThen using the following Elasticsearch Templates, I applied the policy (above), see template line (below) 8, to my indices following a pattern in the line 5\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 # Template sample-logs to apply the ISM Policy delete_after_15d to new indices PUT _template/sample-logs { \u0026#34;index_patterns\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;sample-logs-*\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;settings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;index.opendistro.index_state_management.policy_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;delete_after_15d\u0026#34; } } Now what? Is it ready?\nFor the new indices, yes. The indices created after you created this template into your Elasticsearch.\nWhat about the old ones?\nThe indices created before applying the index template.

Now you have only one index name (index alias) to configure your Custom Program / LogStash / Fluentd, etc and you can forget the suffix pattern.\nHere is an example of how to insert data using the rollover index alias:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 # Bulk load sample, NOTE: To insert data use the rollover aliases POST _bulk {\u0026#34;index\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;_index\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;sample-logs-rollover\u0026#34;}} {\u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;This is a log sample 1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;@timestamp\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2020-04-26T11:07:00+0000\u0026#34;} {\u0026#34;index\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;_index\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;sample-logs-rollover\u0026#34;}} {\u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;This is a log sample 2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;@timestamp\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2020-04-26T11:08:00+0000\u0026#34;} Conclusions If you have Elasticsearch as your logs storage and index platform and you never used before or heard about it:\nIndex State Management (ISM) ‚Üí Open Distro for Elasticsearch Index lifecycle management (ILM) ‚Üí Elasticsearch Elastic Then, Go fast and learn how to apply this to improve your everyday job.\nAcknowledgements This was possible thanks to my friend Alejandro Sabater, who took his free time to review it and share its recommendation with me.\n","permalink":"https://slashdevops.com/post/2020/05/13/1/managing-the-lifecycle-of-your-elasticsearch-indices/","summary":"Managing the Lifecycle of your Elasticsearch Indices Just like me, you are probably storing your [Applications | Infrastructure | IoT ] Logs / Traces (as a time series) into Elasticsearch or at least considering doing it.\nIf that is the case, you might be wondering how to efficiently manage index lifecycles in an automated and clean manner, then this post is for you!\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s happening?
